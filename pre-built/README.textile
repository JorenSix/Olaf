h1. OLAF on Windows

Getting the command line olaf application to work on Windows requires a few steps.

h2. Installing dependencies: ffmpeg and Ruby

Both Ruby and ffmpeg need to be installed on your system and both need to be __available on your path__.

For ffmpeg you need to copy @ffmpeg.exe@ to e.g. @c:\windows\system32@ or another location on your @$PATH@. You can find "recent ffmpeg builds for Windows here":https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds/releases or "here":https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/. Download, unzip and copy the exe. Only @ffmpeg.exe@ is needed.

The easy way to install Ruby on Windows is to use the "Ruby Installer":https://rubyinstaller.org/. Simply install a Ruby environment. Olaf does not need a specific Ruby version: anything Ruby environment above 2.5 will work.  

Now you should be able to call @ruby -v@ and @ffmpeg -v@ on the @CMD@ command line.

h2. Installing Olaf

Download "@olaf_c.exe@ here":https://github.com/JorenSix/Olaf/tree/master/pre-built and copy it to a fixed location. For example @'C:/Program Files/olaf_c.exe'@

Download "olaf.rb":https://github.com/JorenSix/Olaf/blob/master/olaf.rb, open it in a text editor and modify the "EXECUTABLE_LOCATION" to e.g. @'C:/Program Files/olaf_c.exe'@.

Now you can call Olaf as follows, in the directory where olaf.rb is also found:

@ruby olaf.rb store test.mp3@
@ruby olaf.rb query test.mp3@
